# Daily-Blog
This is a daily blog.
I made it in order to learn how to generate HTML markup with plain JavaScript using the Embedded JavaScript templating EJS and Lodash.
There is a compose link in the navigation bar if you want to add a post.
You will find out the rest for yourself 😁.
Don't forget to install the dependencies!

Open your bash inside this folder and type:
npm install

Then type:
node app.js 

And open localhost:3000 and enjoy!

You need to install node first in order to open the project!

Otherwise, feel free to use the code and modify it if you want!
