# Daily-Blog
This is a daily blog.
I made it in order to learn how to generate HTML markup with plain JavaScript using the Embedded JavaScript templating EJS and Lodash.
There is a compose link in the navigation bar if you want to add a post.
You will find out the rest for yourself 😁.
Don't forget to install the dependencies!
